<h2>hey there! &#128587;</h2>

<p>I'm <a href="rsds.ch" targer="_blank">Roland Strasser</a>, a independent project manager with several years of development experience.</p>

<p>Currently I'm working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>different smaller projects for smaller companies as manager and dev.</li>
<li>For <a href="kryptohr.ch" target="_blank">Kryptohr</a> services and courses about crypto.</li>
<li>For several NFT collections and other Crypto Project as dev of the smart contracts and react pages</li>
</ul>
</br>
<p>Generally I'm really interested in crypto, authentication and security topics. Despite several privacy concerns, I decided to give GitHub a try and see where 
this is going!</p>
